## Cold Emails

### EMAIL #1: Spreadsheet Hell

**When to use:** First cold outreach to founders who likely use spreadsheets for sales.

**Subject line options (test these):**
- "Still tracking deals in Google Sheets?"
- "Your pipeline is leaking"
- "The spreadsheet era is over"

---

**Subject:** Still tracking deals in Google Sheets?

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: how are you tracking your sales pipeline right now?

Most founders I talk to at your stage say some version of:
- "Google Sheets... it's a mess"
- "Notion, but nobody updates it"
- "Honestly, just my email inbox"

Here's the problem: spreadsheets don't send follow-ups, they don't remind you to reach out, and they definitely don't update themselves after sales calls.

**We built an AI-native CRM specifically for startup sales teams.**

After every call, our AI:
- Auto-updates the deal (stage, next steps, notes)
- Creates follow-up tasks
- Drafts follow-up emails (you approve before sending)
- Schedules meetings
- Answers questions via chat: "Show me deals closing this month"

No more manual data entry. No more lost deals because someone forgot to follow up.

I'm looking for **5 early-stage startups** to pilot this for 30 days.

**What you get:**
- Free setup (literally 48 hours to go live)
- AI that eliminates 80% of CRM busywork
- Weekly calls where you help shape the product
- Founder pricing if you convert: $99/month flat (not per user) for 6 months

**What I need:**
- You're doing 20+ sales calls/month
- You use Gmail + Google Calendar (we integrate automatically)
- 15 mins/week for feedback calls

The deal: 30 days free. If it doesn't transform your sales process, we part ways. If it does, you lock in founder pricing forever.

Interested? Reply "yes" and I'll send the pilot details.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — We're not trying to be Salesforce. We're built for founders who want a CRM that actually works for them, not against them.

---

### EMAIL #2: Lost Deal Hook

**When to use:** Founders who are actively selling and likely experiencing pipeline chaos.

**Subject line options:**
- "That deal you just lost"
- "The follow-up you forgot to send"
- "Why startups lose deals (it's not your product)"

---

**Subject:** That deal you just lost

[First Name],

Real talk: have you ever lost a deal because someone on your team forgot to follow up?

Or because you couldn't remember what was discussed on the call 2 weeks ago?

Or because your pipeline was so disorganized you didn't realize the deal was slipping?

**This happens to every early-stage startup using spreadsheets to manage sales.**

We built an AI-native CRM that fixes this:

✅ Auto-updates after every call — transcribes, extracts next steps, updates deal stage
✅ Never miss follow-ups — AI creates tasks, drafts emails, schedules meetings
✅ Chat-based interface — ask "show me stalled deals" → get instant answers
✅ Built for speed — set up in 48 hours, not 1 month

I'm running a **30-day pilot with 5 startup teams** to prove this works.

You get:
- Free setup with Gmail, Calendar, Google Meet
- AI that eliminates spreadsheet chaos
- Weekly calls to shape the product
- Founder pricing: $99/month flat (first 6 months)

I need:
- 5-20 person team
- 20+ sales calls/month
- Willingness to try something new

If you're tired of losing deals to disorganization, reply "interested" and I'll send the pilot brief.

### EMAIL #3: The Follow-Up (No Response)

**When to use:** 3-5 days after Email #1 or #2 with no response.

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject line]

---

Hey [First Name],

Didn't hear back — totally get it, you're busy building [Company Name].

One quick thing: if you're still managing deals in spreadsheets, I think you'd find our AI CRM genuinely useful. It auto-updates from calls and sends follow-ups — which is ironic, because that's exactly what I'm doing right now.

If the timing's wrong, no worries. Reply "later" and I'll check back in 3 months.

If the timing IS right, reply "yes" and I'll send you the pilot details (30 days free, 48-hour setup).

[Your Name]

### EMAIL #4: The Breakup (Final Follow-Up)

**When to use:** 5-7 days after Email #3 with no response. Last touch.

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

---

[First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about our AI-native CRM for startups. Since I haven't heard back, I'm guessing the timing isn't right.

No worries at all — I'll close your file for now.

If things change and you want to explore this later, just reply to this email. The pilot offer still stands.

Good luck with [Company Name]. Rooting for you.

## LinkedIn Templates

### LINKEDIN: Connection Request Note

**When to use:** When sending a connection request.

---

Hey [First Name] — saw you're building [Company]. Love what you're doing in [industry/space]. Would love to connect — building in a similar space (AI-native CRM for startups). No pitch, just want to follow your journey. 🤙

---

### LINKEDIN DM: Short (After Connection Accepted)

**When to use:** 1-2 days after they accept your connection request.

---

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! Quick question: how does your team track your sales pipeline right now?

Most founders at your stage say "Google Sheets" or "Notion" — which works until it doesn't.

We built an AI-native CRM that auto-updates from calls, sends follow-ups, and runs your entire sales process on autopilot.

Looking for 5 startups to pilot this for 30 days. Free setup, founder pricing ($99/month flat) if you love it.

If you're doing 20+ sales calls/month and want to see what this looks like, happy to show you a quick demo.

—[Your Name]

---

### LINKEDIN DM: Long (For Warm Connections/Referrals)

**When to use:** When you have a mutual connection or they've engaged with your content.

---

Hey [First Name],

[Mutual Connection / Context: "Saw your post about scaling sales" / "We met at [Event]"]. Loved your take on [specific thing they said/posted].

I'm building something that relates directly to what you were talking about — an AI-native CRM for early-stage teams that eliminates manual CRM work entirely.

Here's the pitch in 30 seconds:
- After every sales call, our AI transcribes → updates the deal → creates follow-ups → drafts emails
- You chat with the CRM: "Show me deals closing this week" → instant answer
- Setup in 48 hours, not 48 days

I'm running a 30-day pilot with 5 startup teams. Free setup, weekly feedback calls where you help shape the product, and founder pricing ($99/month flat) if you love it.

Given that you're [context about their company — "scaling your sales team" / "closing your first enterprise deals" / "just hired your first rep"], I think this could save your team 10+ hours/week.

Would you be down for a 15-min call this week? No pitch, just want to show you the product and see if it's a fit.

—[Your Name]

### LINKEDIN: Comment Strategy (Not a DM — Do This First)

**When to use:** Before cold DMing founders. Build familiarity by commenting on their posts first.

| Their Post About | Your Comment Template |
|---|---|
| Hiring their first sales rep | "Congrats! This is the inflection point where a good system pays for itself. The reps who have clear pipeline visibility from day 1 ramp 2x faster." |
| Sales challenges / losing deals | "This resonates. The hardest part at early stage isn't the pitch — it's the follow-through. So many deals die from forgotten follow-ups." |
| Productivity / tools they use | "Love this stack. Curious — what are you using for sales pipeline management? I've been exploring AI-first approaches and the difference is night and day." |
| Fundraising / growth milestone | "Congrats on the raise! This is usually when the spreadsheet-as-CRM approach starts breaking. Worth systematizing now before it becomes a problem at 2x the team size." |

**Rule:** Comment genuinely on 3-5 of their posts over 1-2 weeks BEFORE sending a DM. They'll recognize your name.

## Community Posts

### REDDIT: r/startups / r/SaaS / r/entrepreneur

**When to use:** Posting in startup/sales communities. Frame as "built thing, seeking feedback" — NOT a sales pitch.

**Title:** Built an AI-native CRM for startup founders tired of spreadsheet hell — looking for 5 teams to test

**Body:**

Hey r/startups,

I built an AI-native CRM specifically for early-stage teams (5-20 people) who are outgrowing Google Sheets but don't want Salesforce complexity.

**What it does:**
- Auto-updates deals from call transcripts (no manual logging)
- Creates follow-up tasks and drafts emails automatically
- Chat interface: "Show me deals closing this week" → instant answer
- Integrates with Gmail, Calendar, Google Meet (setup in 48 hours)

**Why I built this:**
I kept seeing founders lose deals because their sales process was disorganized — deals stuck in spreadsheets, follow-ups forgotten, no visibility into what's actually happening.

The existing CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce) all require manual data entry. Reps hate it, so they don't do it, and the pipeline data is always stale. I wanted to build a CRM that maintains itself.

**Looking for 5 pilot teams:**
- 5-20 employees, B2B
- Doing 20+ sales calls/month
- Currently using sheets/Notion/Airtable (or nothing)
- Want to try an AI-first approach

**What you get:**
- 30 days free
- I personally set it up for you (48 hours to go live)
- Weekly feedback calls (15 mins — I want to hear what's broken)
- Founder pricing if you convert: $99/month flat for 6 months

**What I need:**
- Honest feedback (brutally honest)
- 15 mins/week to tell me what's broken
- Willingness to try something new

If you're interested, DM me or comment below. Happy to answer questions.

Not selling anything — genuinely looking for co-builders who want to help shape this.

### INDIE HACKERS Post

**When to use:** Indie Hackers community. More builder-oriented framing.

**Title:** I'm building an AI-native CRM — here's what I learned after 6 months

**Body:**

Hey IH 👋

I've been building Clianta — an AI-native CRM for early-stage startups — for the past 6 months. Here's a transparent update on what I've learned:

**The problem I'm solving:**
Early-stage startups don't use CRMs. They use spreadsheets, Notion, or just their inbox. The result: missed follow-ups, stale pipeline data, and lost deals.

The existing CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive) require too much manual work, so reps stop using them after 2 weeks.

**What I built:**
A CRM where AI handles the grunt work:
- Auto-updates deals from call transcripts
- Creates follow-up tasks and drafts emails
- Chat-based interface for pipeline queries
- Integrates with Gmail, Calendar, Meet

**Tech stack:** Next.js 15 + Express + MongoDB + Google Gemini 2.5 Pro + 24 custom AI agents

**Where I am now:**
- Product is live and functional
- Looking for my first 5 pilot customers
- Offering 30 days free + founder pricing ($99/mo flat)

**What I've learned:**
1. Building the AI is 20% of the work. Making it reliable is 80%.
2. Startups don't care about features — they care about "will my team actually use this?"
3. The #1 competitor isn't HubSpot — it's Google Sheets + email.
4. Founders will try anything if you make the switching cost zero.

**Ask:** If you're an early-stage B2B startup doing 20+ sales calls/month, I'd love to have you as a pilot customer. DM me or comment below.

Happy to answer questions about the tech, the business, or the GTM approach.

### PRODUCT HUNT: Launch Copy

**When to use:** Product Hunt launch. Prepare this for launch day.

---

**Tagline:** The AI-native CRM that runs itself

**Description:**

Clianta is an AI-native CRM built for startup sales teams who'd rather close deals than update Salesforce.

After every sales call, our AI:
🎯 Auto-updates the deal (stage, notes, next steps)
📋 Creates follow-up tasks for your team
✉️ Drafts follow-up emails (you approve before sending)
📅 Schedules meetings
💬 Answers questions via chat: "Show me deals closing this month"

Built for early-stage startups (5-20 people) who are outgrowing spreadsheets. Set up in 48 hours. $99/month flat — not per user.

**First Comment (by you, on launch):**

Hey PH! 👋

I'm [Your Name], the builder behind Clianta. Here's the backstory:

I kept watching startup founders lose deals because their sales process was chaos — deals in spreadsheets, follow-ups forgotten, nobody updating the CRM. The tools that exist (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce) all require manual data entry, which means reps hate them.

So I built a CRM that doesn't require data entry at all. AI handles the logging, follow-ups, and pipeline management. Your reps just sell.

Under the hood: Next.js + Express + MongoDB + Google Gemini 2.5 Pro with 24 specialized AI agents.

Currently looking for early pilot customers. 30 days free, I personally set up your workspace. If you're a B2B startup doing 20+ sales calls/month — I'd love to work with you.

AMA 🙏

### HACKER NEWS: Show HN

**When to use:** Hacker News Show HN post. Technical audience — lead with the tech.

---

**Title:** Show HN: Clianta – AI-native CRM that auto-updates from sales calls (Google Gemini + 24 agents)

**Body:**

I built an AI-native CRM for startup sales teams. The core insight: CRMs fail because nobody wants to do manual data entry. So I made one that doesn't require it.

**How it works:**
- Sales calls get recorded (Google Meet/Zoom integration)
- AI transcribes and extracts: deal stage changes, action items, key points, objections
- Deals auto-update, follow-up tasks get created, email drafts get generated
- Chat interface for pipeline queries ("show me stalled deals")

**Tech:**
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Express + MongoDB + Redis + BullMQ
- AI: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro via Vertex AI + LangChain
- Agents: Custom multi-agent coordination (24 specialized agents — contact, deal, campaign, briefing, etc.)
- Integrations: Gmail OAuth, Google Calendar, Meet, Slack, Apollo.io

**Why 24 agents?**
Each agent specializes in a domain (contact enrichment, deal analysis, email drafting, meeting prep, etc.). For complex tasks, 2-4 agents collaborate — e.g., "prepare for a meeting" triggers contact + deal + company agents to build a comprehensive briefing.

**Status:** Live at clianta.online. Looking for pilot customers (30 days free).

Feedback welcome — especially on the multi-agent architecture and AI accuracy.
