## Where to Find Targets

### 1. LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Best Source)

**Search filters:**
```
Company headcount: 1-10, 11-50
Industry: Computer Software, Information Technology, SaaS, Internet
Company type: Privately Held
Founded: Last 5 years
Geography: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia
```

**Person filters:**
```
Title: Founder, CEO, Co-founder, Head of Sales, VP Sales
Seniority: Owner, CXO, VP, Director
```

**Advanced tip:** Search for people who recently changed to "Head of Sales" or "Sales Manager" title — they were just hired and are likely setting up systems.

**How many:** Pull 20-30 prospects per session, 2-3 sessions per week = 50-100/week

---

### 2. Apollo.io (Enrichment + Prospecting)

**Filters:**
```
# of Employees: 1-10, 11-20
Industry: SaaS, Software, Technology, Business Services
Technologies: Google Workspace (signal for Gmail/Calendar fit)
Revenue: $0-1M, $1M-10M
Funding: Seed, Pre-Seed, Angel, Series A
Job Titles: Founder, CEO, Head of Sales
```

**Pro tip:** Filter by "Technologies: Google Workspace" — these companies already use Gmail/Calendar, which means easy integration.

**How many:** Export 50 contacts at a time, verify emails before sending.

---

### 3. Crunchbase (Funding Signal)

**Search:**
```
Funding Stage: Seed, Series A
Funding Date: Last 6 months
Category: SaaS, B2B, Enterprise Software
Employees: 1-10, 11-50
Location: US, UK, Canada
```

**Why this works:** Companies that just raised are:
- Hiring (need systems to scale)
- Spending (have budget)
- Professionalizing ops (moving off spreadsheets)

**How to use:** Find companies → get founder names → look them up on LinkedIn → add to outreach list.

---

### 4. Y Combinator Directory

**URL:** https://www.ycombinator.com/companies

**Filters:**
```
Batch: S25, W25, S24, W24 (recent batches)
Industry: B2B, SaaS
Status: Active
Team Size: 2-50
```

**Why this works:** YC companies are:
- Action-oriented (will try new tools)
- Growing fast (need systems)
- Well-networked (will refer you if product is good)

---

### 5. Product Hunt

**Where to look:**
- Daily launches → filter for B2B SaaS tools
- Look for companies that launched in the last 6 months
- Check their team size on LinkedIn

**How to use:** Find the founder → LinkedIn → add to outreach list.

---

### 6. Indie Hackers

**Where to look:**
- Product directory: https://www.indiehackers.com/products
- Filter by revenue: $1K-$100K MRR
- These are bootstrapped founders who make fast decisions

---

### 7. AngelList / Wellfound

**Filters:**
```
Stage: Seed, Series A
Type: SaaS, Marketplace, B2B
Location: US/Remote
Size: 1-10, 11-50
```

---

### 8. Twitter/X

**Search queries:**
- `"just hired" "head of sales" startup`
- `"looking for CRM" startup`
- `"outgrowing spreadsheets"`
- `"sales process is chaos"`
- `"founder" "first sales hire"`

**How to use:** Find founders tweeting about sales challenges → add to outreach list.

---

### 9. Job Boards (Hiring Signal)

**Look for companies hiring:**
- "First Sales Rep"
- "Head of Sales"
- "Business Development"
- "Account Executive"

**Where:**
- LinkedIn Jobs
- AngelList/Wellfound Jobs
- Hacker News "Who is Hiring?" threads

**Why this works:** If they're hiring sales reps, they need CRM infrastructure. Perfect timing.

---

### 10. Reddit / Communities

**Subreddits to mine:**
- r/startups — founders posting about sales challenges
- r/SaaS — SaaS founders discussing tools
- r/sales — sales professionals asking for tool recommendations
- r/entrepreneur — bootstrapped founders

**What to look for:**
- Posts asking "what CRM should I use?"
- Posts complaining about HubSpot/Pipedrive
- Posts about managing sales pipeline
- Comments from founders describing their sales process

---

## Prospect Tracking Spreadsheet

Use this format to track your prospect list:

| Company | Website | Founder | Title | Email | LinkedIn | Employees | Funding | Current CRM | Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | | | Not contacted | |

### Status Options:
- **Not contacted** — In the queue
- **Email sent** — Outreach sent
- **Follow-up sent** — F/U email sent
- **Responded** — They replied
- **Call booked** — Qualification call scheduled
- **Qualified** — Good fit, pilot offered
- **Disqualified** — Not a fit
- **Pilot started** — Moved to pilot tracker

---

## Weekly Prospecting Workflow

### Monday (1 hour)
- [ ] Pull 20 new prospects from LinkedIn Sales Nav
- [ ] Enrich with Apollo.io (get verified emails)
- [ ] Add to prospect tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Research each company (30 seconds each — website, LinkedIn, recent news)

### Tuesday-Thursday (30 mins/day)
- [ ] Send 15-20 personalized cold emails per day
- [ ] Send 10 LinkedIn connection requests per day
- [ ] Follow up on day 3-5 non-responders

### Friday (30 mins)
- [ ] Check Crunchbase for newly funded companies
- [ ] Review Reddit/IH for relevant threads (comment, don't pitch)
- [ ] Review outreach metrics (open rates, response rates)
- [ ] Refine messaging based on what's working

---

## Email Verification Before Sending

**Always verify emails before sending cold outreach:**

1. **Apollo.io** — auto-verifies during enrichment
2. **Hunter.io** — email finder + verification
3. **ZeroBounce** — bulk email verification
4. **NeverBounce** — real-time verification

**Target:** <2% bounce rate. If you're above that, your domain reputation is at risk.

## Outreach Volume Targets

| Week | Emails | LinkedIn DMs | Community Posts | Expected Responses | Expected Calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | 50 | 30 | 3-5 | 5-10 | 2-3 |
| Week 2 | 50 | 30 | 3-5 | 5-10 | 3-5 |
| Week 3 | 50 | 30 | 3-5 | 5-10 | 3-5 |

| **Month 1 Total** | **200** | **120** | **15** | **20-40** | **10-15** |

**Conversion assumptions:**
- Email open rate: 40-60% (good subject lines)
- Email response rate: 5-10% (targeted list)
- Response → call rate: 50% (strong CTA)
- Call → pilot rate: 50% (qualified leads)
