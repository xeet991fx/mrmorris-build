## What You're Getting

Clianta is providing your team with **full, unrestricted access** to our AI-native CRM for 30 days at no cost. This includes:

- **Complete CRM setup** — contacts, deals, pipeline stages, custom fields
- **AI automation** — auto-updates from call transcripts, follow-up task creation, email drafting, meeting scheduling, pipeline stage suggestions
- **Chat interface** — ask questions, take actions, get instant pipeline insights
- **Integrations** — Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet (or Zoom), Slack
- **White-glove onboarding** — we personally set up your workspace within 48 hours
- **Weekly feedback calls** — 15-minute calls where you shape the product
- **Direct founder access** — bugs, feature requests, and questions go straight to the builder

---

## What We Need from You

### Commitment
- [ ] Your **entire sales team** uses Clianta as the primary CRM during the pilot (not just 1-2 people)
- [ ] You join **weekly 15-minute feedback calls** (we schedule around you)
- [ ] You provide **brutally honest feedback** — what's broken, what's missing, what's annoying

### Access (Required for Setup)
- [ ] Gmail account(s) for OAuth connection
- [ ] Google Calendar access
- [ ] Google Meet recording access (or Zoom if that's your tool)
- [ ] Slack workspace (for notifications — optional but recommended)

### Minimum Usage
- [ ] **20+ sales calls/month** as a team (enough volume for AI to learn your process)
- [ ] Team members actually follow up on AI-created tasks (to test if automation works)

## Success Criteria

By day 30, we want to see:

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Time spent on CRM admin | **80% reduction** vs. before |
| Missed follow-ups | **Zero** (AI creates tasks + reminders) |
| Pipeline accuracy | **Data is current**, not 2 weeks stale |
| Team adoption | **Team wants to keep using it** (not forced) |

We'll review these together on the Day 30 call with a before/after comparison.

## What Happens on Day 31

| Option | Details |
|---|---|
| **✅ It works** | Convert to paid: **$99/month flat** (not per-user) for 6 months. Then $199/month or $49/user (whichever is lower). Month-to-month, cancel anytime. |
| **🤔 It's close** | We extend the pilot. I add missing features, we iterate based on your feedback. You decide when to convert — no pressure. |
| **❌ Not a fit** | We part ways. No hard feelings. Your data is exported or deleted per your preference. |

---

## Data & Privacy

- **Your data is yours.** We do not train AI models on your proprietary data.
- **Your data stays private.** No sharing with third parties, ever.
- **Full export anytime.** Request a full CSV/JSON export at any point during or after the pilot.
- **Deletion on request.** If you leave, we delete all your data within 14 days of your request.
- **SOC 2 compliance** is on our roadmap — we follow security best practices today.

---

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a free trial that auto-converts** — you explicitly decide to pay
- ❌ **Not a sales pitch** — this is a co-build with early believers
- ❌ **Not training AI on your data** — your conversations and deals are private
- ❌ **Not a polished enterprise tool** — it's an early-stage product being shaped by your feedback

---

## Why Only 5 Pilots?

We can only support 5 pilots at once because:
- We personally set up each CRM workspace
- We're hands-on fixing bugs weekly
- We're shaping the product based on YOUR feedback

This isn't a mass rollout — it's a co-build with early believers who want a CRM that actually works for them.
