# Clianta — Objection Handling Guide

> **Purpose:** Arm yourself with confident, honest responses to every objection you'll hear from startup founders evaluating AI CRM.

---

## Objection #1: "Why not just use HubSpot Free?"

### What they're really saying:
"There's a free option from a trusted brand. Why should I take a risk on you?"

### Response:

> "Great question — HubSpot Free is a solid product. But there's a key difference: **HubSpot still requires your team to manually log calls, update deals, and create tasks.** It's a database you have to feed.
>
> Clianta is different — after every sales call, our AI automatically updates the deal, creates follow-up tasks, drafts emails, and schedules meetings. Your reps don't touch the CRM at all.
>
> The reason most startups abandon HubSpot isn't the cost — it's that **nobody updates it**. With Clianta, there's nothing to update. It stays current on its own.
>
> And honestly, if your team is disciplined enough to manually update HubSpot every day, it's a fine choice. But if your pipeline is a mess because nobody has time to do admin work — that's exactly what we solve."

### Key differentiators to emphasize:
| | HubSpot Free | Clianta |
|---|---|---|
| CRM updates | Manual (reps log everything) | Auto (AI updates from calls) |
| Follow-ups | Manual task creation | Auto-created tasks + drafted emails |
| Pipeline queries | Click through filters/reports | Ask in plain English via chat |
| Setup time | Days (import, configure, train) | 48 hours (we do it for you) |
| AI features | Limited (paid plans only) | Core to the product |

## Objection #2: "We're too small for a CRM"

### What they're really saying:
"CRMs are for big companies. We're just 5 people. It feels like overkill."

### Response:

> "I hear this a lot — and ironically, **small teams need a CRM more than big ones.** Here's why:
>
> When you're 5 people, there's no margin for error. One missed follow-up, one forgotten deal — that's a significant percentage of your pipeline. At larger companies, those mistakes get absorbed. At your size, they hurt.
>
> The difference with Clianta is it doesn't feel like a CRM. There are no forms to fill out, no dashboards to configure. Your team does calls, sends emails, and has meetings — and Clianta captures everything automatically.
>
> Think of it less as 'a CRM' and more as 'an AI assistant that makes sure no deal falls through the cracks.' If you're doing 20+ calls a month, you're big enough to benefit."

## Objection #3: "We tried CRM before and nobody used it"

### What they're really saying:
"I'm skeptical because we've burned time and money on tools that got abandoned."

### Response:

> "That's actually the most common thing I hear — and it's exactly why we built Clianta differently.
>
> **The reason most CRMs get abandoned is they require too much manual work.** Reps don't want to spend 30 minutes a day updating records when they could be selling. So they stop. Then the data gets stale. Then management can't trust the pipeline. Then everyone gives up.
>
> Clianta breaks that cycle because **there's almost nothing to manually update.** Calls get transcribed and deals get updated automatically. Follow-ups get created automatically. Your team's job is just to sell — the CRM maintains itself.
>
> That said, I'll be honest: adoption still requires that your team actually makes calls through the system and reviews what the AI creates. But the barrier is 10x lower than any CRM you've used before.
>
> How about this — we'll do a 30-day pilot. If by day 15 your team isn't using it, we'll have an honest conversation about why and fix it. If by day 30 it's still not working, we part ways."

## Objection #4: "How is this different from Notion + Zapier?"

### What they're really saying:
"We've hacked together a system that kinda works. Why switch?"

### Response:

> "Notion + Zapier is clever — a lot of founders start there. The challenge is three things:
>
> 1. **No intelligence.** Notion doesn't understand your sales process. It can't tell you which deals are at risk, draft follow-up emails, or suggest next steps. It's a database — you still have to think through everything.
>
> 2. **Zapier breaks.** Every founder I've talked to who uses Zapier for CRM workflows has at least 2-3 broken automations they haven't fixed. It's duct tape.
>
> 3. **No call context.** When your rep has a sales call, nothing automatically updates in Notion. Someone still has to write notes, update the status, and create tasks.
>
> Clianta replaces the whole stack — it's the database + the automations + the AI understanding of what's happening in your sales process. One tool, not five taped together.
>
> But honestly — if your Notion setup is working well and your team actually updates it, don't switch. We're built for teams where the spreadsheet/Notion approach has broken down."

## Objection #5: "What happens to our data if we stop?"

### What they're really saying:
"I'm worried about vendor lock-in, especially with a small/new company."

### Response:

> "Fair concern. Here's our policy:
>
> - **Full export anytime.** You can export all contacts, deals, activities, and emails as CSV or JSON at any point — during the pilot or after.
> - **No lock-in.** We're month-to-month after the pilot. Cancel anytime.
> - **Data deletion on request.** If you leave, we delete all your data within 14 days of your request. No holding it hostage.
>
> We want you to stay because the product works, not because your data is trapped. And during the pilot, we're not even asking for your credit card."

---

## Objection #6: "Can we trust a new/small vendor?"

### What they're really saying:
"What if you disappear? I don't want to build my sales process on something that dies."

### Response:

> "Completely valid. Here's how I think about it:
>
> 1. **The pilot is free and reversible.** You're not signing a 2-year contract. It's 30 days — if it doesn't work, you walk away with zero cost.
>
> 2. **Your data is portable.** Full CSV export at any time. If we vanish tomorrow, you can move everything to HubSpot, Pipedrive, or back to a spreadsheet in 30 minutes.
>
> 3. **You're shaping the product.** As a pilot customer, you have direct access to the builder. Feature requests get prioritized. That doesn't happen at Salesforce.
>
> 4. **Every company you use started small.** HubSpot had 5 customers once. Notion was a 3-person team. The question isn't 'are they big enough?' — it's 'does the product solve my problem?'
>
> If the product doesn't solve your problem, size doesn't matter anyway. If it does — you just got founder pricing and direct access to the team building it."

## Objection #7: "We don't have budget for this right now"

### What they're really saying:
"Either we literally can't afford it, or it's not a high enough priority to spend money on."

### Response (if budget is tight):

> "Totally understand — that's why the pilot is 100% free for 30 days. Zero cost to try it.
>
> After the pilot, founder pricing is $99/month flat — not per user. That's less than most founders spend on coffee for the team. And if $99 is still a stretch, let's talk about what pricing would work.
>
> The real question is: what's a missed deal costing you? If you've lost even one $5K deal because of a forgotten follow-up, the CRM pays for itself for 4 years."

### Response (if it's a priority issue):

> "Got it. Can I ask — what WOULD make this a priority? Is there a specific pain point that would make you say 'yeah, we need to fix this now'?
>
> Because usually what I see is founders wait until they've lost 3-4 deals to disorganization before they decide to fix things. If you're not there yet, I'd rather check back in 3 months than push something you don't need today."

## Objection #8: "We're already using Pipedrive"

### What they're really saying:
"We have something that works OK. Switching cost is high."

### Response:

> "If Pipedrive is working for you, honestly — keep using it. Switching CRMs is disruptive and you shouldn't do it unless the improvement is dramatic.
>
> That said, let me ask: **does your team actually keep Pipedrive updated?**
>
> Because the #1 complaint I hear from Pipedrive users is that reps stop updating it after a few weeks. It's a great UI, but it's still manual. You still have to log calls, update stages, and create tasks by hand.
>
> If your data in Pipedrive is consistently accurate and current — genuinely, stick with it. But if your reps are spending 30+ minutes a day on admin, or if your pipeline data is always stale — that's the gap we fill.
>
> **We can even import your Pipedrive data** if you want to test Clianta side-by-side for a few weeks. No need to burn any bridges."

## Objection #9: "How does the AI actually work? Is it accurate?"

### What they're really saying:
"I'm skeptical of AI hype. Will this actually work or is it just ChatGPT slapped on a CRM?"

### Response:

> "Fair question — there's a lot of AI hype right now. Here's how ours actually works:
>
> **Call Processing:**
> 1. Your sales call gets recorded (via Google Meet or Zoom)
> 2. We transcribe it using speech-to-text
> 3. Our AI reads the transcript and extracts: deal stage changes, key discussion points, action items, objections raised, and next steps
> 4. These get applied to the deal record automatically
> 5. Follow-up tasks and email drafts are created
>
> **Accuracy:**
> - Call transcription: ~95% accurate (industry standard for speech-to-text)
> - Deal stage suggestions: you can set it to auto-apply or review-first
> - Email drafts: always review-before-send (we never auto-send without your approval)
> - The AI learns your specific sales process over time — we configure it during onboarding
>
> **Under the hood:**
> We use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro with custom prompts tuned for sales workflows. It's not generic ChatGPT — it's purpose-built for CRM operations.
>
> During the pilot, I'll be monitoring AI accuracy closely and fixing any issues within 24 hours. The first week is always the roughest — by week 3, it's typically 90%+ accurate on deal updates."

## Objection #10: "What integrations do you support?"

### What they're really saying:
"Will this work with our existing tools?"

### Response:

> "We integrate with the tools most startups already use:
>
> **Email & Calendar:**
> - Gmail (full OAuth — read, send, sync)
> - Google Calendar (two-way sync)
> - Google Meet (call recording + transcription)
> - Outlook (SMTP/IMAP)
>
> **Communication:**
> - Slack (deal notifications, pipeline alerts, team updates)
> - Twilio (SMS — for outbound sequences)
>
> **Data & Productivity:**
> - Google Sheets (import/export)
> - Apollo.io (contact enrichment)
> - Notion (knowledge base sync)
>
> **CRM Migration:**
> - Salesforce (bi-directional sync — if you're migrating from SF)
> - CSV import (from any existing system)
>
> If there's a tool you use that we don't integrate with yet, tell me during the pilot — we prioritize integrations based on pilot customer needs.
>
> **What tools does your team use today?** Let me tell you exactly how we connect."

## One-Line Quick Responses

For rapid-fire objections during calls:

| "What if the AI makes mistakes?" | "It will — especially in week 1. That's why you review before anything sends. By week 3, it's 90%+ accurate." |
| "Can I use this on mobile?" | "The web app works on mobile browsers. A native mobile app is on our roadmap for Q3." |
| "Is this GDPR compliant?" | "Yes — we store data on US/EU servers, support data export, and delete on request. Full GDPR compliance." |
| "How long does onboarding take?" | "48 hours. I personally set up your workspace. Your team gets a 15-minute training." |
| "What if I want custom fields?" | "Full custom field support — during onboarding, I'll set up fields specific to your sales process." |

## The Meta-Rule

If you can't answer an objection, say this:

> "That's a great question and I want to give you an honest answer. Let me look into that and get back to you by [specific time]."

**Never bullshit.** Founders respect honesty above everything. If you don't have a feature, say "we don't have that yet, but it's on the roadmap" or "tell me more about why that matters — maybe there's a workaround."
