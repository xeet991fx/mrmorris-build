# Clianta — 5-Minute Demo Script

> **Purpose:** Create an immediate "aha" moment during qualification calls. This is not a feature tour — it's a problem → solution story that makes founders say "I need this."

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (Do This Before Every Call)

### Demo Workspace Checklist
- [ ] Demo workspace loaded with realistic data (not "Acme Corp" and "John Doe")
- [ ] 15-20 contacts with real-looking names, companies, and deal stages
- [ ] 5-8 active deals across pipeline stages (Discovery → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed)
- [ ] 2-3 deals marked as "stalled" (no activity in 7+ days)
- [ ] Recent activity history (emails, calls, notes) on key deals
- [ ] Gmail + Calendar connected and showing real calendar entries
- [ ] AI chat ready to respond
- [ ] One "simulated call" transcript ready to show auto-update flow

### Demo Environment
- [ ] Browser on Clianta dashboard (not login screen)
- [ ] Tab 1: Pipeline view (kanban)
- [ ] Tab 2: AI chat panel open
- [ ] Tab 3: A contact detail page with rich activity history
- [ ] Close all other tabs/apps (clean screen share)

## The Demo (5 Minutes)

### PART 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

> **What to say:**
>
> "Before I show you anything — I want to show you what your pipeline probably looks like right now."

**Action:** Show a screenshot or mock of a messy Google Sheet with:
- Missing dates
- Outdated stages
- "Need to follow up???" in cells
- No last-contacted info

> **What to say:**
>
> "This is what every early-stage startup's pipeline looks like. Deals in random order, follow-ups forgotten, nobody knows what happened on the last call. Sound familiar?"

**Wait for them to laugh/nod/agree.** If they say "yep, that's us," you're golden.

---

### PART 2: The Pipeline — "Your Data, But Organized" (60 seconds)

**Action:** Switch to Clianta pipeline view (kanban board).

> **What to say:**
>
> "This is the same data — but in Clianta. Every deal has a stage, a value, a next step, and a last-contacted date. But here's the thing: **your team didn't update any of this manually.**"

**Action:** Click on a deal card. Show:
1. **Deal details** — stage, value, close date, probability
2. **Activity timeline** — calls, emails, notes (auto-logged)
3. **Next steps** — AI-suggested actions
4. **Contact info** — enriched with company data

> **What to say:**
>
> "Every time someone on your team has a call, sends an email, or schedules a meeting — Clianta captures it automatically. No more 'did anyone update the spreadsheet?'"

---

### PART 3: The "Wow" Moment — AI Chat (90 seconds)

> **What to say:**
>
> "But the real magic is this."

**Action:** Open AI chat panel. Type (or have pre-typed):

**Query 1:** `"Show me deals that haven't been touched in 7 days"`

> **Wait for AI response.** It should return a list of stalled deals with last activity dates.

> **What to say:**
>
> "See that? I just asked a question in plain English and got an instant answer. No filters, no reports, no clicking through 10 screens. Now watch this:"

**Query 2:** `"What's our total pipeline value this month?"`

> **Wait for response.** Should show total pipeline value with breakdown.

**Query 3:** `"Draft a follow-up email to [Contact Name] about their demo request"`

> **Wait for response.** AI drafts a personalized email based on the contact's history.

> **What to say:**
>
> "Your reps can literally ask the CRM anything — and it knows the answer because it has all the context from every call, email, and meeting. No manual data entry. No searching through inboxes."

---

### PART 4: The Hero Flow — Call → Auto-Update (90 seconds)

> **What to say:**
>
> "Let me show you the flow that saves the most time."

**Action:** Show a recent call recording/transcript in the system:

1. **The transcript** — full call transcription
2. **AI-extracted insights:**
   - Deal stage suggestion (e.g., "Move from Discovery → Proposal")
   - Key discussion points summarized
   - Next steps identified
   - Follow-up task created automatically
   - Follow-up email drafted (pending approval)

> **What to say:**
>
> "After every sales call, our AI:
> 1. Transcribes the conversation
> 2. Updates the deal — stage, notes, next steps
> 3. Creates follow-up tasks for your team
> 4. Drafts a follow-up email (you approve before it sends)
> 5. Schedules the next meeting if one was discussed
>
> **Your rep hangs up the call, and everything is already done.** No logging, no updating spreadsheets, no forgotten follow-ups."

---

### PART 5: The Close (30 seconds)

> **What to say:**
>
> "So that's Clianta. It's a CRM that runs itself — your team focuses on selling, not on admin.
>
> We're doing a 30-day pilot with 5 startup teams right now. I personally set up your workspace, connect your Gmail and Calendar, and import your contacts. You're live in 48 hours.
>
> If after 30 days your team loves it — founder pricing is $99/month flat. If not, no hard feelings.
>
> Does that sound like something your team could use?"

---

## Post-Demo: Handling Responses

### If They Say "Yes, let's do it"
> "Awesome. I'll send you the pilot brief today. Can we kick off Monday? I'll need 30 mins to set everything up, then your team starts using it immediately."

**Action:** Send pilot agreement within 1 hour. Schedule kickoff call.

### If They Say "Sounds interesting, but..."
> "What's your biggest concern?"

Then use the [Objection Handling Guide](./objection-handling.md).

### If They Say "Not right now"
> "No worries. Out of curiosity — what would've made this a yes?"

**Log the reason.** Ask: "Mind if I check back in 3 months?"

## Demo Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do
- Use **their company name** when possible ("Imagine this is [Company]'s pipeline")
- Let the AI respond in real-time (don't use screenshots — show it live)
- Focus on **time saved**, not features
- Keep it under 5 minutes — leave them wanting more
- Ask "Does that match your experience?" after Part 1

### ❌ Don't
- Don't show settings, admin panels, or configuration screens
- Don't list features — show outcomes
- Don't say "we're still building this" during the demo (save caveats for after)
- Don't rush — let each moment land
- Don't show broken or incomplete features
- Don't demo on bad internet (test your connection first)

## Demo Data: Sample Queries That Work

Keep these in your back pocket for live demos:

| Query | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| "Show me deals closing this week" | Pipeline intelligence |
| "Which deals are at risk?" | AI deal health analysis |
| "What did [Contact] say on our last call?" | Context memory |
| "Draft a proposal follow-up for [Company]" | AI email generation |
| "How many deals did we close last month?" | Analytics via chat |
| "What's [Rep Name]'s pipeline looking like?" | Team visibility |
| "Who haven't I talked to in 2 weeks?" | Follow-up reminders |
| "Create a task to follow up with [Contact] on Friday" | Task automation |

## Qualification During Demo

While demoing, listen for these signals:

### 🟢 Strong Buy Signals
- "Can it do [specific thing]?" → They're imagining using it
- "How much does this cost?" → Already thinking about buying
- "When can we start?" → Don't oversell, close
- "Can I show this to my team?" → Decision is forming

### 🔴 Red Flags
- "We already use HubSpot for this" → Wrong ICP, disengage politely
- "Interesting, I'll think about it" → No urgency, likely won't convert
- "Our team is just 2 people" → Too small, won't get enough value
- Multitasking during demo → Not engaged, cut it short
