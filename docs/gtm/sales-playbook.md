## Stage 2: Outreach

### Email Outreach Rules

1. **Personalize the first line** — always reference their company, recent funding, or a post they wrote
2. **Send from a real email** — not noreply@, not a marketing tool
3. **Keep it under 150 words** — founders scan, they don't read
4. **One CTA per email** — "reply yes" or "reply interested"
5. **Time it right** — Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am their time zone
6. **Follow up exactly twice** — Email #3 on day 3-5, Email #4 (breakup) on day 8-10
7. **Stop after 3 touches** — don't be annoying, move on

### LinkedIn Outreach Rules

1. **Comment first, DM second** — engage with 3-5 posts before the DM
2. **Connection request with note** — always include a reason to connect
3. **Wait 1-2 days after acceptance** — don't DM immediately
4. **One message, one follow-up** — that's it
5. **Never send InMail** — it screams spam

### Community Outreach Rules

1. **Be a member first** — comment and help others before posting about yourself
2. **Frame as seeking feedback** — not selling
3. **Share genuine value** — insights, lessons learned, data
4. **Don't cross-post** — different content for different communities
5. **Respond to every comment** — especially critical ones

## Stage 3: Qualification Call

### Before the Call (5 mins prep)

- [ ] Research their company (website, LinkedIn, Crunchbase)
- [ ] Check their team size and recent hires
- [ ] Note any recent funding or milestones
- [ ] Know their likely current "CRM" (sheets, Notion, nothing)
- [ ] Have demo workspace ready (just in case)

### Qualification Call Script (15 minutes)

---

#### Opening (2 minutes)

> "Hey [Name], thanks for jumping on. Quick intro: I'm building Clianta, an AI-native CRM for early-stage startups who are outgrowing spreadsheets but don't want Salesforce complexity.
>
> Before I explain more, can I ask — **how are you managing your sales pipeline right now?**"

**Shut up and listen.** Let them talk. Take notes.

---

#### Discovery (5 minutes)

**Ask these questions (adapt based on conversation):**

| Question | What You're Listening For |
|---|---|
| "What's working about your current setup?" | What to NOT break |
| "What's broken?" | Pain points to anchor on |
| "How many sales calls does your team do per month?" | Volume (need 20+) |
| "What happens when someone forgets to follow up?" | Pain validation |
| "How much time do your reps spend on admin vs. selling?" | Quantify the pain |
| "Have you tried any CRM before?" | Past experience + objections |
| "If you could wave a magic wand, what would your ideal sales process look like?" | Feature validation |
| "Who decides on tools like this?" | Decision-maker check |

**Qualification scorecard (mental checklist):**

| Criteria | Yes/No | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 5-20 person team | | |
| B2B business | | |
| 20+ calls/month | | |
| Currently has NO dedicated CRM | | |
| Founder/decision-maker on the call | | |
| Articulates clear pain | | |
| Asks specific questions | | |
| Moves fast (doesn't say "let me think about it") | | |

**Must have ≥ 5 yes's to proceed to pilot offer.**

---

#### Pitch (5 minutes)

> "Cool. So here's what Clianta does:
>
> It's an AI-native CRM that **runs your sales process on autopilot.**
>
> After every sales call:
> 1. AI transcribes the conversation
> 2. Auto-updates the deal — stage, notes, next steps
> 3. Creates follow-up tasks for your team
> 4. Drafts a follow-up email (you approve before it sends)
> 5. Schedules the next meeting if one was discussed
>
> You can also chat with the CRM — literally ask 'show me deals closing this week' or 'draft a proposal follow-up for [Company]' and get instant answers.
>
> It integrates with Gmail, Google Calendar, and Meet — **set up in 48 hours, not 48 days.**"

**Pause. Let them react.** If they ask questions, answer them. If they say "cool," move to the close.

---

#### Pilot Offer (3 minutes)

> "Here's why I'm reaching out: I'm looking for **5 startup teams** to pilot Clianta for 30 days.
>
> **What you get:**
> - I personally set up your workspace (48 hours to go live)
> - Full AI automation — no manual CRM work
> - Weekly 15-minute calls where you help shape the product
> - Founder pricing if you love it: $99/month flat, not per user
>
> **What I need:**
> - Your entire sales team uses it (not just you)
> - Brutally honest feedback
> - 15 minutes a week for feedback calls
>
> **The deal:** 30 days free. If it doesn't transform your sales process, we part ways. If it does, you lock in founder pricing.
>
> **Does that sound useful?**"

---

#### Close

**If "Yes, let's do it":**
> "Awesome! I'll send you the pilot brief today. Can we kick off [specific day]? I'll need 30 minutes for setup, then your team is live."

- Send pilot agreement within 1 hour
- Schedule kickoff call within 3 days
- Mark as "Pilot Accepted" in tracker

**If "Sounds interesting, but...":**
> "What's your biggest concern?"

Refer to [Objection Handling Guide](./objection-handling.md).

**If "Not right now":**
> "No worries. Out of curiosity — what would've made this a yes?"

Log the reason. Ask: "Mind if I check back in 3 months?"

**If "Let me think about it":**
> "Totally fair. When would be a good time for me to follow up? I don't want to bug you, but I also don't want you to lose the pilot slot."

Schedule a follow-up in 3-5 days. If they don't commit then, move on.

## Stage 4: Pilot Kickoff

### Kickoff Call (30 minutes)

#### Agenda:
1. **Welcome** (5 min) — set expectations, explain the 30-day plan
2. **Technical setup** (15 min) — import data, connect integrations
3. **Quick training** (5 min) — show how to use AI chat, review auto-updates
4. **Set success criteria** (5 min) — agree on what "success" looks like

#### Technical Setup Checklist:
- [ ] Import contacts/deals (CSV or manual)
- [ ] Connect Gmail (OAuth)
- [ ] Connect Google Calendar
- [ ] Connect Google Meet (or Zoom)
- [ ] Set up Slack notifications
- [ ] Add team members
- [ ] Configure pipeline stages to match their process
- [ ] Set up first workflow automation
- [ ] Test AI chat with a sample query

#### Expectations to Set:
> "A few things to know:
> 1. **Week 1 will be rough.** The AI is learning your sales process — it'll make mistakes. I'll fix them within 24 hours.
> 2. **Week 2-3 gets better.** AI accuracy improves as it processes more of your calls.
> 3. **Week 4 should feel smooth.** By then, you shouldn't be thinking about the CRM at all — it just works.
> 4. **Weekly calls** are 15 minutes. Tell me what's broken, what's missing, what's annoying. I take notes, I fix things, I ship updates.
> 5. **Day 30** we review results and decide together. No pressure, no tricks."

## Stage 5: Pilot Management (Weeks 2-4)

### Behind the Scenes (What You Do Between Calls)

| Task | Frequency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Monitor AI accuracy | Daily | Catch and fix errors before they notice |
| Review call transcripts | Daily | Ensure auto-updates are correct |
| Check follow-up completion | 3x/week | Verify tasks are being created and acted on |
| Fix bugs | As needed | Respond within 24 hours |
| Build custom workflows | Weekly | Tailor to their specific sales process |
| Improve AI prompts | Weekly | Fine-tune based on their calls |

### Weekly Feedback Call Structure

| Minute | Topic |
|---|---|
| 0-2 | "How's it going? What stands out this week?" |
| 2-7 | "What's working? What's broken?" (take notes) |
| 7-10 | "What would make this 10x better?" |
| 10-13 | "Here's what I'm fixing/building this week based on your feedback" |
| 13-15 | "Anything else? See you next [day]." |

### Red Flags During Pilot (Act Immediately)

| Red Flag | What It Means | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| Team stops using it after week 1 | Adoption failure | Call founder → ask what happened → simplify onboarding |
| "The AI keeps getting it wrong" | Accuracy issue | Deep dive into errors → fix prompts → manual intervention |
| They cancel a weekly call | Losing interest | Reach out same day → "Is everything ok?" |
| They go silent | They've given up | Call, don't email → "I noticed your team hasn't logged in. What's up?" |
| "We went back to the spreadsheet" | Product failed | Emergency call → understand exactly why → fix or acknowledge |

### Green Flags During Pilot (Lean In)

| Green Flag | What It Means | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| They ask for more features | Engaged and invested | Promise delivery timeline → build it |
| They invite more team members | Organic adoption | Help onboard → make them feel VIP |
| "Can we keep using this after the pilot?" | Ready to convert | Don't wait for day 30 → have pricing convo now |
| They mention it to other founders | WOM starting | Ask for intro → offer referral discount |
| They request API access | Power user | Build relationship → they'll be a long-term customer |
