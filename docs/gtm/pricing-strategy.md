## Pricing Justification

### Why $99/month is Not Too Low

| Factor | Reasoning |
|---|---|
| Market positioning | Below HubSpot Starter ($20/user = $200+ for 10 users), below Pipedrive ($15/user = $150+ for 10 users) |
| Land-and-expand | Get in at $99, grow with them to $149-$299 as team scales |
| WOM engine | Happy founders at $99 tell other founders. This IS your marketing. |
| PMF signal | If they won't pay $99, the product doesn't have PMF. If they happily pay $99, raise prices for next cohort. |
| Cost to serve | AI API costs ~$5-15/user/month (Gemini). $99 for a 10-person team is $9.90/user — healthy margins. |

### Why NOT Free Forever
- Free users don't give quality feedback (no skin in the game)
- Free creates wrong user base (price shoppers, not value seekers)
- Free makes it impossible to understand willingness-to-pay
- $99/month filters for serious teams

## Discounting Rules

### When to Discount

| Scenario | Discount | How to Offer |
|---|---|---|
| Pilot convert, tight budget | $49/month for 12 months | "What if we did $49 for the first year? Let's prove the value." |
| Annual commitment | 10-15% off monthly rate | "$99/mo → $84/mo if you go annual ($1,008/year vs. $1,188)" |
| Referral (they send you another pilot) | 1 month free per referral | "If you refer another startup, you get a month free." |
| Case study agreement | 1-2 months free | "Let us write a case study about your results → 2 months free." |
| YC / Accelerator batch | 20% off first year | "We offer YC batch pricing — $79/mo for the first year." |

### When NOT to Discount

| Scenario | Why Not | What to Say Instead |
|---|---|---|
| They haven't tried the pilot yet | No proof of value | "Let's do the free pilot first. If you love it, we'll talk pricing." |
| They're comparison shopping | They'll never commit | "I'd rather you use HubSpot and be happy than use us and be lukewarm." |
| They want free forever | Wrong customer | "We're a paid product for teams who value their time. Free isn't sustainable." |
| Enterprise negotiation tactics | You're not enterprise | "Our pricing is simple and flat. We don't do 12-month negotiations." |

### Never Go Below
- **$49/month** — this is the absolute floor, and only for annual commitment
- Below $49, customer quality drops dramatically
- If they can't afford $49/month for CRM, they're not your ICP

## Annual Deals

### When to Offer Annual
| Timing | Approach |
|---|---|
| Day 30 (pilot conversion) | Default to monthly. Only offer annual if they ask about discounts. |
| Month 3 (happy customer) | "Hey, if you're planning to stick around, annual saves you 15%." |
| Month 6 (Founder plan ending) | "Your founder pricing expires this month. Want to lock in $84/mo for a year?" |

### Annual Pricing Table
| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Annual (total) | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Founder | $99 | $84 | $1,008 | $180/year (15%) |
| Growth | $149 | $127 | $1,524 | $264/year (15%) |
| Scale | $299 | $254 | $3,048 | $540/year (15%) |

## Competitive Pricing Comparison

### How Clianta Pricing Compares (10-Person Team)

| CRM | Monthly Cost (10 users) | AI Features | Setup Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Clianta (Founder)** | **$99 flat** | ✅ Full AI automation | 48 hours |
| **Clianta (Growth)** | **$149 flat** | ✅ Full AI automation | 48 hours |
| HubSpot Free | $0 | ❌ None | 1-2 weeks |
| HubSpot Starter | $200 ($20/user) | ❌ Basic | 1-2 weeks |
| HubSpot Professional | $900+ ($90/user) | ⚠️ Limited AI | 2-4 weeks |
| Pipedrive Essential | $150 ($15/user) | ❌ None | 1 week |
| Pipedrive Professional | $500 ($50/user) | ⚠️ Limited AI | 1 week |
| Salesforce Starter | $250 ($25/user) | ❌ None | 2-6 weeks |
| Salesforce Enterprise | $1,650+ ($165/user) | ⚠️ Einstein (extra cost) | 1-3 months |
| Close CRM | $290 ($29/user) | ❌ None | 1 week |
| Attio | $340 ($34/user) | ⚠️ Some AI | 1 week |

### Talking Points

**vs. "Free" options (HubSpot Free, Google Sheets):**
> "Free isn't free — it costs you 10+ hours/week of manual data entry. At even $50/hour founder time, that's $2,000/month in opportunity cost. Clianta is $99."

**vs. Per-user CRM:**
> "As your team grows, per-user pricing punishes you. Add 3 reps at $50/user and you're at $650/month. With Clianta, you pay $149 flat whether you have 5 reps or 20."

**vs. Enterprise CRM:**
> "Salesforce costs $1,650/month for 10 users AND you need an admin to manage it AND you still do manual data entry. We're $99 and the CRM manages itself."

## Price Increase Strategy

### Cohort-Based Pricing

| Cohort | When | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **Cohort 1** (Pilots 1-5) | Now | $99/mo for 6 months → $149/mo |
| **Cohort 2** (Customers 6-20) | Month 3-6 | $149/mo (no founder discount) |
| **Cohort 3** (Customers 21-50) | Month 6-12 | $149-199/mo depending on features |
| **Cohort 4** (Customers 51+) | Year 2+ | Standard pricing ($149-299/mo) |

### Rules for Price Increases
1. **Grandfather existing customers** for 12 months minimum
2. **Give 90 days notice** before any price change
3. **Never increase more than 30%** at once
4. **Add value before raising price** — new features, integrations, or better AI
5. **Tell them why** — "We're adding [features], which costs more to deliver"

| LTV:CAC ratio | 12-36x | Extremely healthy |
| Gross margin | ~85-90% | AI API costs are low |

## Handling Price Conversations

### "What does it cost?"
> "During the pilot, it's completely free. If you love it after 30 days, founder pricing is $99/month flat — not per user. That covers your entire team."

### "That's more than I want to spend"
> "I hear you. Let me ask: how much time does your team spend on CRM admin work every week? If it's even 5 hours, and your team's time is worth $50/hour, you're spending ~$1,000/month on manual CRM work. $99 to eliminate most of that is a 10x return."

### "Can I get a discount?"
> "The pilot is already free — that's my discount. $99/month flat is already below every competitive CRM for a 10-person team. If budget is genuinely tight, we can do $49/month for the first year with an annual commitment."

### "Do you do per-user pricing?"
> "We can — $29/user/month. But for teams under 10, the flat rate ($149/month) is usually cheaper. We designed it so you're never punished for growing your team."

### "Do you have enterprise pricing?"
> "We're focused on startups right now. If you're an enterprise team, I'd honestly recommend HubSpot or Salesforce — they're built for that. We're built for speed and simplicity."
