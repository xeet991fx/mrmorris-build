## Email Subject Line A/B Tests

Test these in Week 1-2 to find your best performers:

### Email #1 variants:
| Subject Line | Hypothesis |
|---|---|
| "Still tracking deals in Google Sheets?" | Direct pain callout |
| "Your pipeline is leaking" | Curiosity + urgency |
| "[Company Name]'s sales process" | Personalized |
| "Quick question about your CRM" | Curiosity |
| "10-person startup CRM" | ICP-specific |

### Email #2 variants:
| Subject Line | Hypothesis |
|---|---|
| "That deal you just lost" | Emotional trigger |
| "The follow-up you forgot to send" | Guilt + recognition |
| "Why startups lose deals (it's not your product)" | Curiosity |
| "Your team is losing deals to disorganization" | Direct |

**Winner criteria:** >50% open rate AND >5% response rate → use as default.

## Emergency Playbook

### If zero responses after 50 emails:
1. Check email deliverability (are emails landing in spam?)
2. Try different subject lines
3. Switch from Email #1 to Email #2
4. Try a completely different angle (shorter, more personal)
5. Consider if your ICP is wrong

### If responses but zero calls booked:
1. Make your CTA more specific ("Can we talk Thursday at 2pm?")
2. Reduce friction ("5 minutes, not 30")
3. Add more social proof ("We're working with 3 other YC companies")

### If calls booked but zero pilots:
1. Review your qualification — are you talking to the right people?
2. Improve your demo — is the "aha" moment clear?
3. Reduce pilot commitment — "Just try it for 2 weeks"
4. Ask every non-converter: "What would have made this a yes?"
