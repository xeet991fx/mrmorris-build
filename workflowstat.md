  ❌ What's Missing (Minor Gaps)

  1. Visual Improvements (Nice-to-Have)

  - ⚠️ Minimap for large workflows (ReactFlow has this)
  - ⚠️ Node search (find node by name in large workflows)
  - ⚠️ Zoom to fit button more prominent
  - ⚠️ Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)

  2. Advanced Features (Not Critical)

  - ⚠️ A/B testing within workflows (send 50% version A, 50% version B)
  - ⚠️ Goal tracking (e.g., "Exit workflow when deal won")
  - ⚠️ Wait for event action (e.g., "Wait until email replied")
    - Actually you have waitEventType in config! Just not exposed in UI?
  - ⚠️ Multi-branch conditions (more than YES/NO)
  - ⚠️ Time-of-day filters ("Only run 9AM-5PM EST")

  3. Collaboration (Team Features)

  - ⚠️ Workflow version history (see who changed what, revert)
  - ⚠️ Comments on nodes (team collaboration)
  - ⚠️ Workflow templates marketplace (share between workspaces)
  - ⚠️ Workflow permissions (who can edit vs. view)

  4. Performance (Scale)

  - ⚠️ Workflow cloning (duplicate existing workflow)
  - ⚠️ Folder organization (for 50+ workflows)
  - ⚠️ Workflow search (exists but could be better)
  - ⚠️ Archived workflows view
