## The Math: What This Means for Your Team

### For a 10-Person Sales Team:

**Before MrMorris:**
- 10 reps × 40 hours/week = 400 hours total
- 60% admin work = 240 hours wasted on busywork
- 40% selling = 160 hours actually selling

**After MrMorris:**
- 10 reps × 40 hours/week = 400 hours total
- 20% admin work = 80 hours on admin (automated by AI)
