# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Gandharv
**Date:** 2026-02-05

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Agentic AI implementation for CRM - MCP-based multi-app integration with skills/automation layer

**Goals:**
- Design AI agent architecture with MCP connectivity
- Create skills framework for sales automation
- Enable client self-service automation configuration
- Explore integration patterns and use cases
- Build event-driven automation that reacts to CRM and external app triggers
- Develop deep CRM context understanding for valuable AI assistance
- Enable cross-system workflows that eliminate manual work

### Session Setup

**Approach Selected:** Progressive Technique Flow - Start broad exploration, then systematically narrow focus to actionable solutions

**Core System Capabilities to Explore:**
- Chat-based AI agent with deep CRM context understanding
- Event-driven automation reacting to triggers from CRM or external apps
- Skills framework enabling clients to create custom automations
- MCP-based integration layer connecting multiple external systems
- Cross-system automation spanning CRM and external tools

**Value Drivers:**
- Reduce manual work through intelligent automation
- Provide contextual AI assistance leveraging full CRM knowledge
- Enable client self-service automation configuration
- Create reactive, event-driven workflows across systems

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Progressive Technique Flow
**Journey Design:** Systematic development from exploration to action

**Progressive Techniques:**

- **Phase 1 - Expansive Exploration:** Cross-Pollination for maximum idea generation by transferring successful patterns from other domains (DevOps automation, workflow orchestration, smart home systems, enterprise integration platforms)
- **Phase 2 - Pattern Recognition:** Morphological Analysis for systematically mapping all system parameters and identifying optimal combinations
- **Phase 3 - Idea Development:** SCAMPER Method for refining concepts through seven improvement lenses (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse)
- **Phase 4 - Action Planning:** Decision Tree Mapping for creating implementation roadmap with decision points and sequencing

**Journey Rationale:** This progressive flow is ideal for complex technical systems requiring both creative exploration and structured development. Starting with cross-domain insights ensures we don't reinvent the wheel, morphological analysis helps us map the solution space comprehensively, SCAMPER refines our best ideas systematically, and decision tree mapping creates clear implementation pathways.

## Phase 1: Expansive Exploration (Cross-Pollination)

**Status:** ✅ Complete - 96 ideas generated

**Key Discovery Areas:**

1. **Architecture Patterns** - Event-driven workflows, durable execution, state machines, composable skills
2. **Cost Optimization** - Serverless invocation, tiered intelligence, batch processing, smart caching
3. **Orchestration** - Dependency graphs, parallel execution, compensating transactions, retry strategies
4. **UI/UX Approaches** - Natural language instruction writing, conversational wizard, manual structured prompts, dual-mode interface
5. **Testing & Debugging** - Dry runs, historical replay, cost estimation, breakpoint debugging, canary releases

**Critical Insights:**
- Users want natural language skill definition (conversational wizard + manual structured prompts as dual mode)
- Skills must be durable workflows that can span days/weeks with state persistence
- Cost control is essential - can't run AI 24/7, need event-driven invocation and smart batching
- Skills need conditional logic, composition (calling other skills), and cascading event chains
- Testing with real data preview is critical before production activation

**Domains Cross-Pollinated:**
- DevOps/CI-CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
- Workflow engines (Temporal, Airflow, Prefect)
- Smart home automation (Home Assistant, HomeKit)
- RPA tools (UiPath)
- No-code platforms (Zapier, Make.com)
- Game engines (Unity, Unreal event systems)
- Visual programming (Scratch, Node-RED)
- Testing tools (Postman, Cypress)

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (Morphological Analysis)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Objective:** Systematically map all system parameters and identify optimal combinations for the agentic AI CRM architecture.

**Parameters Mapped:** 10 key dimensions with 3-5 options each
1. Skill Definition Interface
2. Event Trigger Architecture
3. Execution Model
4. AI Invocation Strategy
5. Conditional Logic & Branching
6. Skill Composition
7. Approval & Permissions
8. Testing Strategy
9. Cost Optimization
10. Error Handling & Resilience

**Selected Configuration: "Comprehensive Agentic Platform"**
- Dual-mode interface (Wizard + Manual structured prompts)
- All trigger types (CRM, webhooks, time, manual, cascading events)
- Flexible execution (Immediate + Durable workflows + Hybrid)
- AI-First strategy (with evolution path to optimization)
- Composable skills architecture
- User-defined approval in instructions
- Dry run testing with cost estimation
- Event-driven only (no persistent processes)
- Circuit breaker error handling

**Key Insight:** Maximizes flexibility while maintaining cost consciousness through event-driven architecture. Evolution path allows starting AI-heavy and optimizing based on learned patterns.

## Phase 3: Idea Development (SCAMPER Method)

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

**Objective:** Refine the selected configuration through seven improvement lenses to enhance features, address trade-offs, and discover innovations.
