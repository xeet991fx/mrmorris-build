## The 6 Problems We DON'T Try to Solve

These are important CRM challenges, but they're **NOT our focus** because they don't directly impact daily sales productivity:

### ❌ **Cost** (Procurement Problem)
- One-time purchase decision
- Not a daily pain point for sales reps
- Finance/leadership concern, not sales automation

### ❌ **Vendor Selection** (Buyer Problem)
- Happens once during evaluation
- Doesn't affect daily selling workflow
- Marketing problem, not sales automation

### ❌ **Training** (HR/Onboarding Problem)
- Periodic need, not daily friction
- Our solution: Make the CRM so easy it needs no training
- AI does the work FOR you, not instructions on how to do it yourself

### ❌ **Approval/Authority** (Management Problem)
- Organizational/political issue
- One-time implementation blocker
- Not a technology problem

### ❌ **Customization** (IT Problem)
- Setup phase concern
- We solve with sensible defaults, not complex configuration
- Works out-of-the-box for sales teams

### ❌ **Scalability** (Future Problem)
- Important but not an immediate daily pain
- Modern infrastructure handles this by default
- Not a differentiator for sales automation

## The Bottom Line

**We don't solve all 11 CRM problems.**

**We solve the 5 problems that kill sales productivity every single day.**

Everything else is noise. Our focus is laser-sharp on automating the three activities that waste the most sales time:
1. Manual data entry
2. Manual follow-ups
3. Manual reporting

If it doesn't save a sales rep time or help them close more deals, we don't build it.
